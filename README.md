# -Add-Employee-Static-webpage
A simple webpage that allows a user to add employees to a database. 
Node.js is used to run the page on a local server

Within the 'AddEmployee.js' file are different ideas on how to POST the JSON file to server||.txt file||.php file etc
most have been commented out. The fetch API is the most concise. Unfortunately I keep running into
a code 405 error when the API is called, so until this has been resolved, the static web page cannot
communicate with said server etc.
HOWEVER - I have been able to run the web page using Node.js. My aim now is to use Node.js as the back-end
for this project and POST/GET JSON data between the client and the server this way. */
